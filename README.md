# GDAS_GFS_DATA

## NCEP GDAS/FNL 0.25 Degree Global Tropospheric Analyses and Forecast Grids
These NCEP FNL (Final) operational global analysis and forecast data are on <strong>0.25-degree by 0.25-degree grids</strong> prepared operationally every six hours. This product is from the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS), which continuously collects observational data from the Global Telecommunications System (GTS), and other sources, for many analyses. 

## Global Forecast System (GFS)
The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) weather forecast model that generates data for dozens of atmospheric and land-soil variables, including temperatures, winds, precipitation, soil moisture, and atmospheric ozone concentration. The system couples four separate models (atmosphere, ocean model, land/soil model, and sea ice) that work together to accurately depict weather conditions.
